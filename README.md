# Youtube Video Player

A React-based web app that uses the Youtube API to cleanly showcase playable Youtube videos from a user's search request.

I learned a ton about Javascript, React, JSX, functional and class-based components, communicating with props, the state system, life cycle methods, calling APIs, web development, and UI design.

This is a project I created for Stephen Grider's React and Redux 2020 course on Udemy.
